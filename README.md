# Python_Zomato_DataAnalysis
This project analyzes Zomatoâ€™s restaurant data using Python. It identifies popular restaurant types, votes received, and common ratings. We assess couples' average online spending, compare online vs. offline ratings, and find which restaurants get more offline orders. Insights will help Zomato optimize promotions and boost customer engagement.
